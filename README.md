<!-- FAQs -->
## FAQs

 * How do I access NeoCommunism V2?
   * You can access NeoCommunism V2's dashboard at http://localhost:5595/.
 * Can I go in-game?
   * No, however, NeoCommunism++ is available to use for in-game support, Check it out [here](https://github.com/NeoCommunismDev/NeoCommunismPP).
 * Will I get banned?
   * No, you won't get banned because NeoCommunism V2 doesn't connect to any Epic Games related services.
 * How do I play with my friends?
   * NeoCommunism V2 is a locally-hosted project, meaning it has no party or friends functionality.
 * Why don't I see any cosmetics in my locker?
   * We removed cosmetics because Epic Games made it clear it does not like services that offer cosmetics for free. If you wish for skins you're welcome to add them yourself.
